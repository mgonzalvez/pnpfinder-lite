Be that nobody and become a somebody. Grim(m) World is a solo open-world card game set in the fairy tale world of the Brothers Grimm. Here you play an ordinary person who sets out to experience adventure. The player is not told how his journey should look like. He is free to decide where he goes and what he wants to do. Maybe he wants to accumulate trade and wealth? Or does he want to make a name for himself as a bounty hunter? Maybe he also wants to save Little Red Riding Hood from the bad wolf or even help the wolf hunting Little Red Riding Hood. The world reacts and changes based on your decisions. Are you ready for this adventure? Grim(m) World is based on the OWCS (Open World Card System). The OWCS is a system to simulate an Open World as a card game. An encounter deck with multi-use cards serves as a random encounter, as an object deck, it triggers quests, dice rolls are simulated, it defines prices for trading and it simulates the time in the game world. An additional quest deck simulates the living world in the game. Depending on the time in the game, new missions appear or disappear, events happen or the world changes. Additionally, your own character can be leveled up and becomes stronger and stronger as the game progresses. The battles in the game are fought on a grid field laid out with cards. Your hand cards serve as life points and determine the character's possible actions during a fight. The opponents are controlled by a simple card-based AI.",https://raoulschaupp.itch.io/grimm-world-first-steps,,Cards,"5 Meeples, 1 Cube",English,2021,https://storage.googleapis.com/glide-prod.appspot.com/uploads-v2/Ji677LVwrgF6rmMlGpTL/pub/y1Z0wv1iOkgQaGhnzCHY.jpg,,help@pnpfinder.com

It is whispered that some foul spirit lingers, tied to a curse and unable to depart. Maybe one day somebody will have the pluck and luck to find the cursed relic and remove it from the asylum, releasing the ghost to rest in peace. Maybe that day is today. And maybe that somebody is you... The Asylum is a small dice-based solitaire game. Each time a room is entered for the first time, a relic is found and dice are assigned for future moves. The player must complete three tasks to gain the clues that will identify the cursed relic. Then they must get that relic and escape from the asylum, all using the limited dice rolls available. Extra rolls are available by locking the room, but this shuts down the possibilities for future movement. And once the ghost is alerted to your presence it comes after you.

Everyone plays a card, and the lowest card on suit wins the trick. But cards are worth points equal to their value and you discard cards when you win a sale, so winning with higher cards is better. The longer you wait in the round, the easier it is to win with a higher card, and if you wait until you don't have many cards to discard you can cheese the card out for less waste. People Edition adds set collecting cards, wild cards, and tableau building to the Park Life. Do you focus on a single suit? Do you go wide and wild? Do you hold big cards until the end of each round when you are guaranteed to win one? You keep the cards you win until the end of the game, so you can strategize over the three hands of the game.",https://charminggames.itch.io/people,,59 cards,,English,2024,https://storage.googleapis.com/glide-prod.appspot.com/uploads-v2/Ji677LVwrgF6rmMlGpTL/pub/uVXRpZLUWFt3TUCfgYv4.jpg,,help@pnpfinder.com

It’s pretty small in scale; you can play solo or co-op with a friend, and it’s only played using a few decks of cards and some tokens. You get to choose one Phantom Thief to play as (even Akechi makes the roster), and then in very Persona fashion you have to make some hard choices, because each turn—represented by a day of the month—you can only do one thing. Players can go recruit confidants (like Shinya, Miishima and Iwai) to gain perks, go to school to increase social stats, explore locations around them or make a run on the palace, defeating shadows in combat and trying to reach the boss. This recreates the exact same stresses as Atlus’ game. How do you best invest the time given to you? If you spend too long getting ready you might not clear the palace in time, but if you rush the palace unprepared you might screw things up.
