    "intro": "In-hand games are, as the name implies, a deck of cards that are played entirely while being held and carried in your hand. Most of them feature a clever use of rotating and flipping cards, and position/movement of cards in the deck, as their main game mechanisms. Although in-hand PnP games are small and compact, the best of them provide a fun and engaging game experience that punches far above their diminutive size. My first experience with in-hand PnP games was Jon Mietling's excellent [Palm Island](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=255), a town-building, resource collection Euro game experience played entirely in the palm of your hand. I still consider that game (released in 2018) to be a classic, PnP or otherwise. Another in-hand PnP game I have enjoyed is Frank Druet's [Pocket Planet](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=66), a science-fiction-themed, pocket-sized Euro game of planetary exploration, resource collection, and conversion. I have also played and enjoyed Joe Klipfel's [Hand of Destiny](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=343), which started life as a wonderful free PnP game called [Griphold Tower](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/248665/griphold-tower-pnp). I hope you enjoy exploring this wonderful sub-category of PnP games that offer you vast worlds of adventure and imagination...in the palm of your hand. -- *Martin Gonzalvez*",

    "intro": "Since I first entered the board game hobby, I have always loved deck building games. I just can't get enough of that feeling of starting with a basic, low-power deck of cards, then that irresistible gameplay loop of playing cards, to purchase better cards, to build up your deck, to play more powerful cards, to purchase even more powerful cards, and so on. I have over 30 deck building games in my collection, and I don't think I'm going to stop \"building up\" my collection of deck building games anytime soon. It's no surprise, then, that I also have a longtime fascination with PnP deck building games. In fact, the very first PnP game I ever crafted, a super rough build printed on the backs of discarded card stock, was Manuel Correia's clever and thematic [Agent Decker](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=0), a taught, tightly-designed 54-card game of stealth casting you in the role of a spy whose goal is to sneak deep into a high-tech fortress to complete six increasingly challenging deck-building missions. There are a number of excellent free PnP rethemes of popular deck building games, including Wilhelm Su's [Calvin and Hobbes retheme](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=186) of [After The Virus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/232361/after-the-virus), and Chris De Villiers' epic [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles retheme](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=187) of [Friday](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43570/friday). If you want to dip your toe into the world of PnP deck building games, you'll find quite a few of them here on PnPFinder to pique your interest. -- *Martin Gonzalvez*",

    "cycle": true,
    "intro": "I didn't really understand the appeal of worker placement games when I first tried one. My first PnP worker placement game was [Mint Works](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=307) by Justin Blaske. It was a cute theme, but I was horrible at the game. After that I tried the free PnP of [Grease Monkey Garage](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=483), and again, I thought the game had a good theme, but the main mechanism left me cold. After that, I tried the PnP of the game [Maquis](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=59), designed by Jake Staines, with art by the great Ilya Baranovsky. Finally, I understood the worker placement mechanism. It's a staple mechanism of many Euro games, which can at times feel dry and abstract, hence the expression JASE (Just Another Soulless Euro). If one is used to more thematic games, the worker placement mechanism in many Euro games can feel dry and soulless. On the other hand, there are many other gamers for whom that supposedly dry and soulless worker placement mechanism can feel soothing and cozy. As I progressed in my board gaming journey, I came to appreciate the worker placement mechanism more and more. Nowadays, some of my favorite games have worker placement as their main mechanism. There is something pure and deeply satisfying about placing your worker on a spot on the board, and getting a benefit, or triggering an action, or my favorite, triggering a long chain of combo actions that require planning and forethought to pull off. I even ended up designing my very own free PnP post-apocalyptic worker placement game a couple of years ago: [Do Not Go Gentle](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=109), and in my conceit, I think it's one of the best games that I have ever designed. The moral of this story? Don't close the door on a game mechanism, that initially didn't appeal to you. It might end up becoming one of your favorites in the fullness of time. -- *Martin Gonzalvez*",

    "intro": "Rethemes are a unique part of the print and play hobby. The motivation behind a retheme is most often along the lines of (thinking to oneself) Hey, that's a great game, but wouldn't it be better if it had a different theme? The first free PnP retheme I ever learned about and crafted was Ricardo Gonzalez's [Mario retheme of Carcassonne](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=234); it blew my mind back then that such a thing existed, and it still amazes me even today. Another incredible free PnP retheme that made a huge impression on me was the famed board game artist Kwanchai Moriya's [Neolithic Ops](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=358), a prehistoric retheme of Fantasy Flight Games' out-of-print Nexus Ops. Still another wonderful retheme project I stumbled upon on BGG was Marianne Waage's beautiful and thoughtfully made free PnP retheme of [Tiny Epic Galaxies](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=195). There exists a vast world of wonderfully creative free PnP retheme projects out there, if you so choose to explore them. -- Martin Gonzalvez",

    "intro": "I love dice placement games. There's something very satisfying about rolling dice, then placing your rolled dice in spots on the board or on card to fulfill requirements to do good things (like gain benefits) and make things happen in the game. The first free PnP dice placement game I ever played was [Deep Space D6](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=548), designed by Tony Go. In the game you play the captain of a starship facing both external and internal dangers. Your dice represent your crew members. Each turn, you roll your dice and then decide which department of your starship to place them (for example, the Bridge, or Engineering, or Tactical, etc.) where they will do the most good for the current situation. It's fast, it's challenging, and it's a lot of fun. One of my favorite dice placement games is [Fantastic Factories](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=191), which I consider to be an all-time PnP classic. You place your dice on basic actions to build out your own factory made up of cards that you purchase from a central market. As you build out your personal tableau of cards, they provide additional spaces for you to place your dice, extending your menu of available actions. The game complexity ramps gently and by the end, you have built out a very satisfying factory complex with personalized capabilities. The last free PnP dice placement game I'll mention is [The Artemis Project](https://pnpfinder-lite.pages.dev/game?id=291), where you lead a team of explorers to a mission to colonize Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. The game features wonderful artwork, and a lovely and creative gameplay loop where you place your dice in various spaces above and below the surface of Europa to perform various tasks and complete thematic missions. If you want to dive deeper into dice placement, a game mechanism that I personally adore, you'll find a humber of worthwhile examples of this mechanism here. -- *Martin Gonzalvez*",
